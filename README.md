# Ripple pond effect

This project contains Ripple pond effect widget. It makes wave when you click on it!
There is still many things to improve in this widget so feel free to contribute. I just share my work, it is not production ready code, you can copy it and adjust for your needs.

## PondWidget
You can insert any Widget into it, and ripples appear on top of it!
